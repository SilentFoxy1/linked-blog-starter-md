# What is a wheatstone bridge

A Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit. It was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833 and later popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843. The circuit is highly sensitive to changes in resistance and is commonly used in precision measurement devices, such as strain gauges and sensors.

#### **Basic Structure:**

A Wheatstone bridge consists of four resistors arranged in a diamond shape:

- Two resistors (R1 and R2) are placed in one leg of the bridge.
- Two other resistors (R3 and Rx) are placed in the second leg.
- The bridge has a voltage source applied across one diagonal and a measurement device (such as a galvanometer or voltmeter) across the other diagonal to detect a voltage difference.

#### **Working Principle:**

- The bridge is balanced when the ratio of the two known resistors (R1/R2) is equal to the ratio of the unknown resistor (Rx) and the reference resistor (R3). In this balanced state, there is no current flowing through the measurement device, and the voltage difference is zero.
    
- **Balanced Condition:**
    
$$
    \frac{R1}{R2} = \frac{R3}{Rx}â€‹
$$
    
    This allows the unknown resistor (Rx) to be calculated if the other three resistances are known.
    

#### **Applications:**

- **Measuring Resistance**: The Wheatstone bridge is widely used to measure very small changes in resistance, which are difficult to detect with direct methods.
- **Strain Gauges and Sensors**: It's often employed in strain gauge sensors, thermistors, and other transducers, where small changes in resistance indicate changes in physical conditions like strain, temperature, or pressure.
