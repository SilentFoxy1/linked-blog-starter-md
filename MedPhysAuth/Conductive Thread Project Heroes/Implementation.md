### Practical Implementation of the circuit

1. **Breadboard Setup**:
    
    - I began by building the Wheatstone bridge circuit on a breadboard.
    - I used two 100-ohm resistors for two arms of the bridge.
    - To create the required 200-ohm resistor, I used either two 220-ohm resistors or two 150-ohm resistors in parallel, depending on availability.
2. **Conductive Thread Calculation**:
    
    - I calculated the length of the conductive thread based on the circumference of my diaphragm.
    - I doubled this length since the thread would be sewn in a folding pattern to allow flexibility and proper resistance measurement during breathing.
3. **LED Circuit**:
    
    - The LED circuit required specific resistors to limit current. Since the exact resistors werenâ€™t available, I improvised by connecting one 150-ohm and one 240-ohm resistor in series.
4. **Final Connections**:
    
    - Once the Wheatstone bridge and LED circuits were complete, I connected the entire setup to an Arduino Mega for processing and control of the breathing monitor system.
