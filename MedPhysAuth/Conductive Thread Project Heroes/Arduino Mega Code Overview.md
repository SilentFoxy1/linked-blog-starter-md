**Initial Code Implementation**:

- The initial code uploaded to the Arduino Mega was designed to read the analog values from the Wheatstone bridge connected to pin A0. This code mapped the sensor values to an LED brightness level, providing a visual representation of the breathing pattern. The basic structure of the code included:
    - Reading analog values from the sensor.
    - Mapping these values to a range suitable for controlling the LED brightness (0 to 255).
    - Using `analogWrite()` to adjust the LED's brightness based on the mapped values.

Here is a simplified version of the initial code used:
```
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
    int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
    int ledBrightness = map(sensorValue, 400, 530, 0, 255);
    analogWrite(ledPin, ledBrightness);
    Serial.println(sensorValue);
    delay(100);
}

```
1. **Future Code Enhancements**:
    
    - Moving forward, the code will require enhancements to accommodate the integration of an operational amplifier and ensure more accurate readings from the Wheatstone bridge.
    - Adjustments may include:
        - Modifying the `map()` function to reflect the new sensor value range, once the op-amp is integrated.
        - Implementing additional filtering or averaging techniques to smooth out fluctuations in the readings, which can be particularly useful when dealing with small resistance changes.
        - Adding functionality to log data over time for further analysis, allowing us to evaluate breathing patterns more effectively.
    
    The updated code will ensure that the system can accurately respond to real-time changes in the resistance of the conductive thread, thus enhancing the overall monitoring capability of the wearable device.
