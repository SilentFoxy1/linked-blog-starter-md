# KiCad Overview

KiCad is a free software like Altium for pcb and circuits design.

# KiCad schematic for conductive thread

On the left there is a Wheatstone bridge with 3 resistors, 2 of them 100Ohms and 1 of 200Ohms, the next resistor is the Rthread which I measured with the multimeter that it should be around 60-70ohms.
On the right part of the [[KiCad screenshot.png]] I used a LED with a 360Ohm resistor for the prototype.
